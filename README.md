# TinyPomodoro4Mac

**TinyPomodoro4Mac** is a lightweight Pomodoro timer designed specifically for macOS. This project was created in an afternoon as an experiment to learn how to code with the assistance of ChatGPT. The app resides in the macOS menu bar and helps you manage your work and break cycles effectively.

## Features

- **Simple Pomodoro Timer**: Predefined work (25 minutes) and break (5 minutes) durations.
- **Menu Bar Integration**: Displays the remaining time directly in the menu bar for easy tracking.
- **Intuitive Controls**: Start, pause, and reset the timer with simple menu options.
- **Lightweight and Distraction-Free**: Focus on your tasks without unnecessary distractions.
